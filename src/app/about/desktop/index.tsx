        Jupiter Magazine is a quarterly arts and culture publication that marks
        a restorative departure into an editorial space that is a nexus of
        political consciousness, spiritual awareness, and creative healing.
        Grounded in expressive care and expanded with cosmic phenomenology,
        Jupiter began as a prayer, a spell, and an incantationâ€”a belief that a
        world could be built through naming a desire. As two writers working
        within, but venturing beyond, the restrictive systems of the art world
        and the constraining vocabulary of art criticism, co-founders Camille
        Gallogly Bacon and Daria Simone Harper came together first through an
        admiration for each other&apos;s work, and have since co-conspired
        towards the building of Jupiter: a publication invested in disrupting
        industry standards in service of creating conditions that support more
        viable writing lives.

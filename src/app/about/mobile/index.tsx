          Jupiter Magazine is a quarterly arts and culture publication that
          marks a restorative departure into an editorial space that is a nexus
          of political consciousness, spiritual awareness, and creative healing.
          Grounded in expressive care and expanded with cosmic phenomenology,
          Jupiter began as a prayer, a spell, and an incantationâ€”a belief that a
          world could be built through naming a desire. As two writers working
          within, but venturing beyond, the restrictive systems of the art world
          and the constraining vocabulary of art criticism, co-founders Camille
          Gallogly Bacon and Daria Simone Harper came together first through an
          admiration for each other&apos;s work, and have since co-conspired
          towards the building of Jupiter: a publication invested in disrupting
          industry standards in service of creating conditions that support more
          viable writing lives.

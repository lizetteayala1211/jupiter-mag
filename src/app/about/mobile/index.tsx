          As two writers working within, but venturing beyond, the restrictive
          systems of the art world and the constraining vocabulary of art
          criticism, co-founders Camille Gallogly Bacon and Daria Simone Harper
          came together first through an admiration for each other&apos;s work,
          and have since co-conspired towards the conjuring of Jupiter Magazine:
          a publication invested in disrupting industry standards in service of
          creating conditions that support more viable writing lives. Grounded
          in expressive care and expanded with cosmic phenomenology, Jupiter
          began as a prayer, a spell, and an incantationâ€”a belief that a world
          could be built through naming a desire. This quarterly arts and
          culture publication marks a restorative departure into an editorial
          space which resides at the nexus of political consciousness, spiritual
          awareness, and creative healing.

            It&rsquo;s inevitable that I begin this way&mdash;there are actually
            multiple genocides happening as I write this&mdash;but the loudest
            one is playing out in our phones as the illegitimate state of Israel
            massacres the Palestinian people. Tens of thousands of martyrs call
            on the name of God as their world is bombed around them. All wars
            are fought with stories&mdash;I can&rsquo;t look at a television
            because the media is scrambling with lies, disseminating these
            narratives as fast and as wide as they can. Around the world,
            citizens of our violent states are swarming the streets in protest,
            and I think that is a better, truer story&mdash;that people of the
            world did not stand by and do nothing in the face of atrocity, while
            these children were killed, while entire lineages were slaughtered,
            while hospitals were bombed and journalists assassinated, while our
            governments sent money to keep it going.

            We are watching young people in Gaza report their lives and deaths
            over social media while Israel tries to destroy their connection to
            the outside world so that their stories can die with them. I could
            tell you a story about the propaganda spread by those who wish
            Palestinians dead. I could tell you the rebuttals made in response
            and we could argue over figures and facts, fall into a tangled story
            that is, in the end, a distraction from the terrible thing that is
            happening. True things are true whether we want to look at them or
            not. I have my own memories: I remember what it&rsquo;s like to pass
            multiple bodies heaped at the side of the road, to see a dead person
            float in floodwater, bloated. I remember what it all smells like
            after many days.

            When I turned thirty-five, it felt like I had finally arrived at
            myself. It wasn&rsquo;t particularly peaceful, but it did feel like
            I could trust my own mind at last. I finally had
            clarity&mdash;brilliant, blinding clarity. I knew who I was. I knew
            what I could offer the world and what, despite my desires, I could
            not. This process was slow. It took months, endless sessions of
            trauma therapy, and by the time I turned thirty-six, my God, it had
            been tested. I had faltered, I had rallied, I had sobbed and
            screamed and been hunted in nightmares, but the clarity kept burning
            through me until I rang like shocked crystal. Here&rsquo;s what I
            learned:
          </span>
        </p>
        <p className="c0" style={{ color: "white" }}>
          <span className="c1" style={{ color: "white" }}>
            The best thing I can do is to tell stories and make art, and that is
            enough. Quite frankly, I could have stopped my career after my first
            book and that would&rsquo;ve been enough. When the world burns, my
            methods do not change because the world has always been burning,
            enough for me to want to die to get away from it. I have always been
            telling stories; I have always been making art. In multiple
            interviews over several years, I&rsquo;ve said I want this world to
            burn to the ground so something better can be bent into its place.
            I&rsquo;ve always meant it. This horror has been commonplace, yet we
            witness it with fresh grief each time because commonplace
            doesn&rsquo;t and should never mean acceptable.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p className="c0" style={{ color: "white" }}>
          <span style={{ color: "white" }}>
            So I tell stories about the burning, about the imperfect phoenix
            afterward, and about freedom and love. These stories are
            uncomfortable; they anger people who believe in conformity, they get
            my books banned and teachers threatened for assigning these stories
            to their students. But I believe that freedom starts between us, in
            the choices we make, like when someone picks up happiness, when we
            refuse to cave to abusive patterns of expected behavior, even at the
            risk of being ostracized by family and society. I can write that
            into a romance novel and people scoff because it&rsquo;s not
            literary, but then you see how it affects readers, whether it
            incenses them to a fury or brings them to tears. You realize how
            deeply people feel about freedom when someone else is taking it and
            they feel like they can&rsquo;t, or what it means to a reader when
            someone whispers through a page&mdash;

          <span className="c1" style={{ color: "white" }}>
            . My point is, there is nothing a story can&rsquo;t do. You can bend
            a whole new world with stories and that is an enormous threat to
            those who want this terrible world and its associated structures to
            stand.

            In my work, I am centered on the premise that our indigenous
            realities are real, true, and valid. I live at this center, I write
            and paint and make music from this center. I refuse to move, and in
            the vein of Toni Morrison, I wait for the world to move over. This
            is perhaps the most powerful story I can tell with my life, to claim
            the indigenous center and let that red earth twist around my ankles,
            dragging my tarsal bones into the warm soil, digging in and down
            until I am the earth and it is me and it no longer matters that a
            white man with a gun ever looked upon us.

            I&rsquo;ve written books about this, seminal texts that help other
            people reclaim their own indigenous centers. I watch it spread like
            quickfire as we learn new eyes, as we hold them in our hands coated
            in old blood and shove them into our faces. When we see each other,
            we are all regenerated. We are so ancient; they should be terrified
            of us.

            In a Lagos penthouse in Old Ikoyi, light spills out of glass doors
            and into a lush terrace filled with people and voices. The guests
            lounge on carved wooden chairs and the night is hot, ice singing
            quietly in their glasses under the loud hum of overlapping chatter.
            People are still dying across the world and people are always dying,
            suffering down the road, in the water, under a bridge. I stand in
            Lagos now and decades ago, people stood here untouched by war,
            having drinks while my grandfather was bombed in his village during
            the Biafran genocide, chatting and laughing while he died there,
            before I was born. Is being alive inevitably being complicit?
            Sometimes, when the despair creeps in, I wonder if the only
            acceptable solidarity is death. The new clarity washes that
            away&mdash;I&rsquo;ve survived too many suicide attempts to let this
            world grind me into nonexistence again. The work continues. Life
            continues, unrelenting and insistent. My friend, the writer Ann
            Daramola says&mdash;
          </span>
          <span className="c6">&ldquo;</span>
          <span className="c6">
            Somebody still has to make breakfast the morning after the world
            ends.

            I stand against a large clay pot and look out at the mint growing in
            garden boxes hanging off the terrace. Around the corner, red bell
            peppers darken on their stems. We are at &Igrave;T&Agrave;N, a test
            kitchen run by my friend Chef Michael El&eacute;gb&egrave;d&eacute;,
            another storyteller doing things with a world. Weeks before, the two
            of us had sat in my art studio in Tribeca and talked about
            mythology, if it means something real or something made up, about
            whose stories are considered fictional and whose are considered
            sacred. The first time I ate at &Igrave;T&Agrave;N, he told me a
            story about a guest&rsquo;s discomfort with the clay plates he
            serves the food on, because the vessels were too close to those used
            to make offerings to the gods. Pagan Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; things,
            you see, the blasphemous indigenous showing up in the last place
            they expected&mdash;a pinnacle of fine dining by an acclaimed chef
            trained in the West. Chef El&eacute;gb&egrave;d&eacute; is nothing
            if not deliberate with the centers he has chosen for the world he is
            bending, the story he is telling.

          <span className="c1" style={{ color: "white" }}>
            As the dinner starts, we pour in from the terrace and find our seats
            along the enormous table that stretches through the penthouse
            space&mdash;a tree yawned in half and drowned in lacquer, smooth
            grain and natural edges. Chef El&eacute;gb&egrave;d&eacute; stands
            where we can all see him, dressed in black and with bronze carvings
            on his braided locs, stainless steel tools tucked into a pocket on
            his sleeve. He tells us how the word &igrave;t&agrave;n means story
            or history and introduces us to the current menu, based on Yoruba
            mythology. The nine courses we&rsquo;re about to be served are
            accompanied by a soundscape of or&iacute;k&igrave; and stories about
            the orisha. We are in an exhibition, eating edible art, drinking out
            of clay cups made in Kaduna. The earthenware is cool against my
            fingers like it was centuries ago. Our menu is given to us page by
            page, perforated paper that we turn into a book, a story we can take
            to remember. Before the dinner, I ask Michael what story he is
            telling with &Igrave;T&Agrave;N.

            realities, without our gods, without our values and stories. The
            scale of the loss never fails to stagger me, all that has been
            ripped away, all the bullshit that was handed to us in the name of
            colonialism. They destroyed our cities, killed and sold us in
            swathes, shoved their reality down our throats with guns and blood,
            fracturing our teeth, and then they told us there was nothing worth
            turning back for. Even now, decades after, hundreds of millions of

            into the contemporary, we are not seized in the past. It will taste
            like &Igrave;T&Agrave;N, like Abakaliki rice steamed in water lily

            I used to be consumed by despair. The world was always too loud with
            its suffering, seemingly pointless, and I was always haunted by the
            knowledge that no amount of beauty or joy could justify a fraction
            of the horrors inflicted on the most vulnerable of us in the name of
            greed and capitalism and white supremacy. I tried to die multiple

            impair our ability to worldbend, ones that serve our oppressors, not
            us. So we must become hunters, tracking down other stories to
            counter these insidious ones. We who want a better world, we learn
            to start at home, in our families and relationships and communities.
            The revolution begins in spirit. None of us can save anyone alone.
            We simply do our best, within our capacity so we can stay alive to
            do our best another day. We try and we live, we witness and we

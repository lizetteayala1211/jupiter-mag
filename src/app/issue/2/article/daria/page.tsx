        An infinite downpour falls before me, <br />
        a shield as I unsheathe my depth <br />
        to become one with it. <br />
        Submerged within, we hold one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gliding off edges of slick palm fronds, <br />
        pelting the dark ground below us, <br />
        I am washed â€˜til I transform into it, <br />
        moved with the same velocity <br />
        the same force <br />
        the same ability to cover everything. <br />
        To envelop.
      </p>

      <p>
        Saplings draped in siren songs <br />
        usher us to our source. <br />
        This force, this everything <br />
        froths and flusters around us <br />
        into a soft curtain. <br />
        A swell that ends as abruptly <br />
        as it begins.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have come within inches or less <br />
        of drowning before, <br />
        of existing in realms beyond <br />
        this one we know and trust <br />
        despite its (echoing and resonant) <br />
        uncertainty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every second of my breathing <br />
        works toward floating better. <br />
        Encasing myself in more ease. <br />
        I wish to be of water, <br />
        for it is the meaning of my name.
      </p>

      <p>
        As orbiting bodies reach points of closest encounter. <br />
        As listening transmutes frequencies to languages of love. <br />
        Particles meet waves, forming prayers. <br />
        Breathing underwater, <br />
        may we discover the depths of heaven.
      </p>

      <p>May we hear the sea.</p>

          When Keith Jarrett sat at his overhauled Steinway in October of
          &lsquo;98, he had been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and he
          was in love with his second wife, Rose Anne, to whom the unplanned
          album,{" "}
        </span>
        <span className="c5">The Melody at Night, With You</span>
        <span>, would be dedicated. </span>
        <span className="c1">
          To say that it was unplanned is not to suggest a lack of preparedness,
          but to emphasize that which only such a lack can prepare one for. Now
          behold, a body strained yet animated by the essential instinct of the
          lover: to speak the fullness of feeling.
        </span>

          In the fourth track, &ldquo;Someone to Watch Over Me,&rsquo;&rsquo;
          this fullness finds not a peak but a hollow. A low and severe timbre.
          Reaching all the way back to Gershwin&rsquo;s original, Jarrett takes
          the standard into a territory whose contours&mdash;longing, sadness,
          hope&mdash;are sharpened rather than dulled by restraint{" "}

          Suppose that in listening closer, the lover&rsquo;s voice interrupts,
          by necessity, the voice of the critic and the voice of reportage.
          Suppose that in listening closer, one acquires the vagrant fluency of
          the implicated, and must, in the narrow cubits of confession,
          relinquish all claims to an objective position. Surrounded &amp;
          surrendered now not by or to an audience but by and to the face one
          knows well&mdash;or perhaps not well&mdash;which itself suggests
          skill, but sweetly, the way a tongue knows anything as an accumulation
          of sensations. And in this accumulation, the tongue, unbridled,
          crosses the distance between the verb to hold{" "}
        </span>
        <span>and its object.</span>
        <span className="c1">
          &nbsp;That is to say, the tongue, unbridled, learns to speak in other
          tongues.

          What Jarrett insists upon is a conspiratorial grammar, a mode of

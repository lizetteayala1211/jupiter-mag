          When Keith Jarrett sat at his overhauled Steinway in October of
          &lsquo;98, he had been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and he
          was in love with his second wife, Rose Anne, to whom the unplanned
          album, &lsquo;&rsquo;The Melody at Night, With You&rsquo;&rsquo;,
          would be dedicated. To say that it was unplanned is not to suggest a
          lack of preparedness, but to emphasize that which only such a lack can
          prepare one for. Now behold, a body strained yet animated by the
          essential instinct of the lover: to speak the fullness of feeling.

          In the fourth track, &lsquo;&rsquo;Someone to Watch Over
          Me&rsquo;&rsquo;, this fullness finds not a peak but a hollow. A low
          and severe timbre. Reaching all the way back to Gershwin&rsquo;s
          original, Jarrett takes the standard into a territory whose contours
          &ndash;longing, sadness, hope&ndash; are sharpened rather than dulled
          by restraint &amp; elision. A slurring speech

          Suppose that in listening closer, the lover&rsquo;s voice interrupts,
          by necessity, the voice of the critic and the voice of reportage.
          Suppose that in listening closer, one acquires the vagrant fluency of
          the implicated, and must, in the narrow cubits of confession,
          relinquish all claims to an objective position. Surrounded &amp;
          surrendered now not by or to an audience but by and to the face one
          knows well &mdash;or perhaps not well&ndash; which itself suggests
          skill, but sweetly, the way a tongue knows anything as an accumulation
          of sensations. And in this accumulation, the tongue, unbridled,
          crosses the distance between the verb to hold and its object. That is
          to say, the tongue, unbridled, learns to speak in other tongues.

          What Jarrett insists upon is a conspiratorial grammar, a mode of
          articulation restricted to the most intimate of addresses, a grammar
          in which what is spoken is spoken to enact and confirm what is shared:

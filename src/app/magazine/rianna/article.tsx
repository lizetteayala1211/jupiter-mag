          the UNIA headquarters was relocated to the Black Metropolis of Harlem,
          New York, synchronizing the cultural, political, and economic chords
          of the Pan-African coalition. With shifts in socio-political alignment
          through travel and self-study, transatlantic freedom movements were
          breaking down and interrogating boundaries between Black peoples.

          The imaginings of Albert Artwell, one of Jamaica&rsquo;s most
          prominent self-taught artists, were spun with biblical stories, town
          scenes, and seascapes. Adamant that God is Black and that Jesus had
          African ancestry, his religious visions fitted the prophecy of Marcus
          Garvey: &ldquo;Look to Africa where a Black king shall be crowned, he
          shall be the Redeemer.&rdquo; The genesis of Artwell&rsquo;s artistic
          life were surfaces with supremely decorative calligraphy of passages
          from the Scriptures. His recasting of Christ&rsquo;s story and other
          biblical wisdoms meant that Bethlehem was set in Jamaica and the main
          actors were Black.

          One approach to the content, form, and structure of the Black
          aesthetic is a totality of social commitments, cultural values, and
          conventional wisdom. This approach considers the syndrome of internal
          factors governing a Black audience&#39;s perception and appreciation
          of a work of art. Our evaluation is a study of means rather than ends,
          because the message is only part of the poem and part of its success.{" "}

          Often concerned with joy and justice, there is a strong desire for

          The Black aesthetic transmutes with time as well as geography. It
          mirrors the Garvey-era shift in socio-political alignment, achieved
          through travel and self-study and produced enduring transatlantic
          liberation movements. The human source of this may be based either on
          genius, artistic skill, or studious activity, which are just some
          essential pillars needed for creating styles and virtuosity.
          Overarching this is a whole process of living, ruling oneself, working
          for oneself, feeding and entertaining oneself as a matter of life.{" "}
